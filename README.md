This is my fake news detection repository.

Deepfake technology uses Generative Antagonistic Networks (GANs), in which two models of machine learning compete. The first model trains on a set of data, then create video forgeries while the other tries to detect the forgery.

This continues until the second model cannot detect the fake in the first model. The bigger the training dataset, the easier it is to create a very believable Deepfake that would fool people.

Researchers from various universities performed some tests to show how easy it is to manipulate and edit these videos and images. Scientists have combined several techniques to create fake videos and test how easy it is.

As technology matures with the wrong person taking hold of it, the consequences could be dire.

Regardless of the Deepfake videos, we have to be wary and vigilant about how this will be used in the future. The potential disaster that this technology could wreak havoc on all of us around the world is something we may never see coming.
